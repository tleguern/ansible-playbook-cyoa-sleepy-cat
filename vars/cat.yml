  intro:
    msg: |-
      You are a small cat, lazily sleeping through the day in the most
      relaxing way. It's been an hour already since the beginning of your nap
      and an important question came to your mind.
    choices: [ "left", "right", "as is" ]
    question: "Should you roll to your [left] side, to your [right] side or stay [as is]?"
  left:
    msg: |-
      You roll to your left side and pursue your intense napping. From time
      to time you open an eye, just one, in order to check on your humans.
      Sometimes they squeal annoyingly and touch you on the head. It is not
      that you _don't_ like it but you don't like liking it. Except perhaps
      when they use their ridiculous excuse for claws on the forehead, this is
      actually quite good.

      Anyway, there are no humans on sight, it is time to return back to
      sleep.
    question: "Type [end]."
    choices: [ "end" ]
  right:
    msg: |-
      You roll to your right side and pursue your intense napping. From time
      to time you wake up for a good session of back stretching. It is
      _really_ exhausting to nap with such intensity, clearly you need a rest.
    question: "Type [end]."
    choices: [ "end" ]
  "as is":
    msg: |-
      You are already in the best possible position, why should you move a
      muscle?
    question: "Type [end]."
    choices: [ "end" ]
  end:
    msg: |-
      After some more time passes you wake up, get down from your place and
      trot swiftly toward the humans' rest area. After a nap nothing beats a
      good sleep.
